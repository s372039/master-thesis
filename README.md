# Master Thesis Repository

This repository contains all code and configuration files used in my master thesis project, organized into three distinct directories. Each directory corresponds to a specific component of the thesis, drawn from separate working repositories to compile the full scope of the project here for archival and evaluation purposes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into the following directories, each containing related project files:

### 1. **system_management**
   - This directory includes all scripts and configuration management files used on the master server. It contains infrastructure setup and configuration details necessary to replicate the server settings and services used during the thesis.

### 2. **central_data_repository_application**
   - Contains the API code for the central data repository of the project.
   - Also includes the Docker configurations (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`) and continuous integration/continuous deployment (`CI/CD`) configurations using `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

### 3. **in-ear_detection_repository**
   - This folder houses the notebook used for the in-ear detection experimentation with ML algorithms in the thesis.
   - It includes code snippets for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation and visualisation that were part of the experimental setup.

## Overview

Each directory is intended to be a standalone set of files that are part of larger systems. They have been grouped here to provide a comprehensive overview of the project components for thesis evaluation purposes. These files are snapshots from active development environments and are intended for review rather than direct use.

## Documentation

Each directory contains its own `README.md` file, which provides detailed information about the files within that directory, including how to set them up and run them, if applicable. Please refer to these individual READMEs for detailed instructions and contextual information.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive archive of all the code and configurations used in the master thesis project. It is designed to illustrate the scope of work and methodologies employed during the research.
